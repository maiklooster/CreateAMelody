## Create a Melody

Welcome to our song generator, Create a Melody! Hit run and the program will prompt you to enter a music note (by typing a scale degree), or it can generate a random note for you. Your note will be drawn on the sheet music, and you will hear its sound. Then, you can continue entering as many new notes as you would like until your song is finished. Exit the program, and it will play the whole song!
